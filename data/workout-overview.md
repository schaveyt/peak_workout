# Workout Overview

Hereâ€™s a 4-month (16-week) rotating workout plan that balances German Volume Training (GVT), strength/hypertrophy phases, deloads, and cardio. Itâ€™s designed to minimize fatigue while prioritizing fat loss and muscle retention. Each week includes daily workouts, cardio, and goals.

## Key to Table

GVT: 10x10 compound lifts @ 60% 1RM + accessories.

Strength: 4â€“6 reps @ 75â€“85% 1RM.

Hypertrophy: 8â€“12 reps @ 65â€“75% 1RM.

LISS: Low-intensity steady-state cardio (walking, cycling) at 60â€“70% max HR.

HIIT: High-intensity intervals (e.g., 30s sprint/1m recovery).

## 4-Month Workout Schedule

(Adjust rest days as needed; "Active Recovery" = yoga, walking, or mobility work)

--see spreadsheet--

## Notes

Circuit Training Example (Week 14):

5 rounds: 10 KB swings, 15 push-ups, 20 bodyweight squats, 30s plank (minimal rest).

Adjustments:

Swap exercises for joint-friendly alternatives if needed (e.g., leg press instead of squats).

Reduce HIIT to 1x/week if fatigued.

Cardio: Stick to 60â€“75% max HR for LISS (~103â€“129 bpm).

# Monthly Goals Overview

Month	Primary Focus
1	GVT endurance + fat adaptation
2	Strength/power + muscle retention
3	GVT density + metabolic push
4	Conditioning + sustainable loss

## Critical Tips

Track Progress: Weigh yourself weekly, take measurements, and adjust calories if weight loss stalls.

Nutrition: Maintain 220g protein/day and stay in your 2,300â€“2,600 calorie range.

Supplements: Creatine (5g/day), omega-3s (reduce inflammation), and electrolytes.
